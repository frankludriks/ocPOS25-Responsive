 5 - Fix:  When adding a non-inventory item to an order, required fields are now correctly marked as required.
 6 - Fix:  Currency was still hardcoded to USD in some places
 7 - Fix:  Non-inventory items could contribute inappropriately toward an order's tax total

11 - Fix:  Simplified configuration required to use database table prefixes.

15 - Fix:  Added products.products_prid field when needed for compatability with ZenCart
16 - Fix:  Tax classes can be deleted in osCommerce without de-associating those tax classes from products.  While this causes taxes not to be applied in osCommerce, taxes were still being applied in ocPOS.  This has been fixed.
17 - Fix:  Tax lookups did not work properly if store is using database table prefixes
18 - Fix:  Product searches were limited to 4 search terms.  In certain situations, the product search would return the entire product catalog rather than the proper search results.

3  - Specials were not displayed properly in product.php and product_edit.php

9  - renamed header.php to header.zip to avoid getting FTP uploaded in ASCII mode and thereby corrupting the file
10 - reduced package size by only including ioncube loaders for Win32, Linux and FreeBSD.  Other loaders can be downloaded from http://www.ioncube.com/loaders.php.
11 - Updated ioncube loaders with versions from Jan 20, 2007.

4 - Comments placed during Point of Sale order are now viewable from osCommerce Admin, not just from the Point of Sale interface
5 - The database table names are now abstracted into includes/db_tables.php .  This means that if you are using other database table prefixes (feature of ZenCart, add-on for osCommerce and others) that you can configure these prefixes in db_tables.php to allow OllaCart Point of Sale to read the tables properly.
6 - Receipts now auto-print after checkout.  Receipt auto-print will only occur at the conclusion of the checkout.  Viewing receipts under any other circumstance will not auto-print the receipt.
7 - Currency symbol is now read from the osCommerce (or ZenCart, etc) database rather than being hardcoded to the $ symbol
8 - When creating a new customer, state field is now populated with the store's default state 
9 - POS purchases were not correctly updating the products_ordered field in the products table.  This field is used by the "Best Products Purchased" report in osCommerce.  It is not used to keep track of inventory.  This bug did not affect the inventory counts.
10 - SQL statements to add to the order_status_history table failed in some cases
11 - Removed reporting dependency on existence of a contribution that is not part of stock osCommerce code
12 - Replaced expiring header.php with non-expiring header.php
